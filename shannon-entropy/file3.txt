down below there was only a vast white sea of clouds above there was the sun and the sun was white like the clouds because it is never yellow when one looks at it from high in the air he was still flying the spitfire his right hand was on the controls it was quite easy the machine was flying well he knew what he was doing everything is fine he thought i know my way home ill be there in half an hour when i land i shall switch off my engine and say help me to get out will you i shall make my voice sound ordinary and natural and none of them will take any notice then i shall say someone help me to get out i cant do it alone because ive lost one of my legs theyll all laugh and think im joking and i shall say all right come and have a look then yorky will climb up on to the wing and look inside hell probably be sick because of all the blood and the mess i shall laugh and say for gods sake help me get out he glanced down again at his right leg there was not much of it left the bullets had hit him just above the knee and now there was nothing but a great mess and a lot of blood but there was no pain when he looked down he felt as if he were seeing something that did not belong to him it was just a mess which was there something strange and unusual and rather interesting it was like finding a dead cat on the sofa he still felt fine and because he still felt fine he felt excited and unafraid i wont even bother to radio for the ambulance he thought it isnt necessary and when i land ill sit there quite normally and say some of you fellows come and help me out will you because ive lost one of my legs ill laugh a little while im saying it ill say it calmly and slowly and theyll think im joking then when i get out ill make my report later ill go up to london ill take that bottle of whisky with me and ill give it to bluey well sit in her room and drink it when its time to go to bed ill say bluey ive got a surprise for you i lost a leg today but i dont mind if you dont it doesnt even hurt  well go everywhere in cars i always hated walking then he saw the sun shining on the engine cover of his plane he saw the sun shining on the metal and he remembered the aeroplane and remembered where he was he realized that he was no longer feeling good that he was sick and his head was spinning his head kept falling forward on to his chest because his neck no longer seemed to have any strength but he knew that he was flying the spitfire between the fingers of his right hand he could feel the handle of the stick which guided it im going to faint he thought he looked at the controls seven thousand metres to test himself he tried to read the hundreds as well as the thousands seven thousand and what as he looked he had difficulty reading the dial and he could not even see the needle he knew then that he must get out that there was not a second to lose otherwise he would become unconscious quickly he tried to slide back the top but he didnt have the strength for a second he took his right hand off the stick and with both hands managed to push the top back the cold air on his face seemed to help he had a moment of great clearness his actions became automatic that is what happens with a good pilot he took some deep breaths from his oxygen mask and as he did so he looked out over the side down below there was only a vast white sea of cloud and he realized that he did not know where he was itll be the english channel he thought im sure to fall in the water he slowed down pulled off his mask undid his safety equipment and pushed the stick hard over to the left the plane turned smoothly over on to its back and the pilot fell out as he fell he opened his eyes because he knew that he must not become unconscious before he had opened his parachute on one side he saw the sun on the other he saw the whiteness of the clouds and as he fell as he turned in the air the white clouds chased the sun and the sun chased the clouds suddenly there was no longer any sun but only a great whiteness it was so white that sometimes it looked black and after a while it was either white or black but mostly it was white he watched it as it turned from white to black and then back to white again and the white stayed for a long time but the black lasted only a few seconds he seemed to go to sleep during the white periods and to wake up just in time to see the world when it was black it was white when he put out a hand and touched something he took it between his fingers and felt it for a time he lay there letting the tips of his fingers play with the thing which they had touched then slowly he opened his eyes looked down at his hand and saw that he was holding something which was white it was the edge of a sheet he closed his eyes and opened them again quickly this time he saw the room he saw the bed in which he was lying he saw the grey walls and the door and the green curtains over the window there were some roses on the table by his bed and beside the roses was a small medicine glass this is a hospital he thought i am in a hospital but he could remember nothing he lay back on his pillow looking at the ceiling and wondering what had happened he was staring at the smooth greyness of the ceiling which was so clean and grey and then suddenly he saw a fly walking upon it the sight of this fly touched the surface of his brain and quickly in that second he remembered everything he remembered the plane and he remembered the dial showing seven thousand metres he remembered jumping out he remembered his leg it seemed all right now he looked down at the end of the bed but he could not tell he put one hand underneath the bedclothes and felt for his knees he found one of them but when he felt for the other his hand touched something which was soft and covered in bandages just then the door opened and a nurse came in hello she said so youve woken up at last she was not goodlooking but she was large and clean she was between thirty and forty and she had fair hair he did not notice more than that where am i youre a lucky fellow you landed in a wood near the beach youre in brighton they brought you in two days ago and now youre better you look fine ive lost a leg he said thats nothing well get you another one now you must go to sleep the doctor will be coming to see you in about an hour she picked up the medicine glass and went out but he did not sleep he wanted to keep his eyes open because he was frightened that if he shut them again everything would go away he lay looking at the ceiling the fly was still there he was still watching it when the nurse opened the door and stood to one side while the doctor came in he was an army doctor with some military ribbons from the last war on his chest he had a cheerful face and kind eyes well well he said so youve decided to wake up at last how are you feeling i feel all right youll soon be walking again the doctor took his wrist to check his blood pressure he said some of the lads from your base were ringing up and asking about you they wanted to come and see you but i said theyd better wait a day or two just lie quiet and rest for a bit got something to read he glanced at the table with the roses no well the nurse will look after you shell get you anything you want then he went out followed by the nurse when they had gone he lay back and looked at the ceiling again the fly was still there and as he lay watching it he heard the noise of an aeroplane in the distance he lay listening to the sound of its engines it was a long way away i wonder what it is he thought let me see if i can recognize it suddenly he moved his head to one side anyone who has been bombed can tell the noise of a german junkers  it is a noise one cannot mistake he lay listening to the noise and felt quite certain about what it was but why was there no alarm and no guns that german pilot was certainly taking a risk coming near brighton alone in daylight the aeroplane was always far away and soon the noise faded into the distance later there was another this one too was far away but he was sure he recognized the sound he remembered the noise clearly from air battles he had fought he was puzzled there was a bell on the table by the bed he reached out his hand and rang it he heard the noise of footsteps down the corridor the nurse came in nurse what were those aeroplanes i dont know i didnt hear them probably fighters or bombers i expect they were returning from france why whats the matter they were german i know the sound of the engines there were two of them what were they doing over here the nurse came to the side of his bed and began to straighten the sheets youre imagining things you mustnt worry would you like me to get you something to read no thank you she brushed back the hair from his forehead with her hand they never come over in daylight any longer you know that she said they were probably british nurse yes could i have a cigarette of course you can she went out and came back almost immediately with a packet of cigarettes and some matches she gave him one and when he had put it in his mouth she struck a match and lit it if you want me again just ring the bell she went out later he heard the noise of another aircraft it was far away but nevertheless he knew that it was a singleengine machine it was going fast he could tell that it wasnt a british aircraft it didnt sound like an american engine either they make more noise he did not know what it was and this worried him greatly perhaps i am very ill he thought perhaps i am imagining things i simply do not know what to think that evening the nurse came in with a basin of hot water and began to wash him well she said i hope you dont think that were being bombed he did not answer she rubbed some more soap on him and began to wash his chest youre looking fine this evening she said they operated on you as soon as you came in they did a marvellous job youll be all right ive got a brother in the raf she added flying bombers he said i went to school in brighton she looked up quickly well thats fine she said i expect youll know some people in the town yes he said i know quite a few she had finished washing his chest and arms now she turned back the bedclothes so that his left leg was uncovered she did it in such a way that the rest of his injured leg remained under the sheets she took his pyjama trousers off and now began to wash his left leg and the rest of his body this was the first time that he had had a bedbath and he was embarrassed she laid a towel under his leg and began washing his foot she said this soap is awful to use its the water its so hard he said none of the soap is very good now and of course with hard water its hopeless as he said it he remembered something he remembered the baths which he used to take at school in brighton he remembered how the water was so soft that you had to take a shower afterwards to get all the soap off your body he remembered that sometimes the school doctor used to say that soft water was bad for your teeth in brighton he said the water isnt he did not finish the sentence he had thought of something something so unbelievable that for a moment he felt like telling the nurse about it and having a good laugh she looked up the water isnt what she said nothing he answered i was dreaming she wiped the soap off his leg and dried him with a towel its nice to be washed he said i feel better that night he could not sleep he lay awake thinking of the german aircraft and of the hardness of the water he could think of nothing else they were german he said to himself i know they were but it is not possible because they would not be flying around so low over here in daylight i know that it is true and at the same time i know that it is impossible perhaps i am ill perhaps i am imagining all this for a long time he lay awake thinking these things and once he sat up in bed and said aloud i will prove that i am not crazy but before he had time to think any more he was asleep he woke just as the first light of day was showing through the gap in the curtains at the window he remembered the junkers  and the hardness of the water he remembered the large pleasant nurse and the kind doctor and now the doubt in his mind began to grow he looked around the room the nurse had taken the roses out the night before there was nothing except the table with a packet of cigarettes and a box of matches the room was bare it was no longer warm or friendly it was not even comfortable it was cold and empty and very quiet his doubt and fear grew so that he became restless and angry it was the kind of fear one gets not because one is afraid but because one feels that there is something wrong he knew that he must do something that he must find some way of proving to himself that he was either right or wrong and he looked up and saw again the window and the green curtains from where he lay that window was right in front of him but it was ten metres away somehow he must reach it and look out the idea took hold of him and soon he could think of nothing except the window but what about his leg he put his hand underneath the bedclothes and felt the bandages around what remained of his right leg it seemed all right it didnt hurt but it would not be easy he sat up then he pushed the bedclothes away and put his left leg on the floor slowly carefully he swung his body over until he had both hands on the floor as well then he was out of bed kneeling on the carpet he looked at what remained of his right leg wrapped in bandages it was beginning to hurt he wanted to lie down on the carpet and do nothing but he knew that he must go on with two arms and one leg he crawled over towards the window he would reach forward as far as he could with his arms then he would jump and slide his left leg along after them it was painful but he continued to crawl across the floor on two hands and one knee when he got to the window he reached up and one at a time he placed both hands on the sill slowly he raised himself up until he was standing on his left leg then quickly he opened the curtains and looked out he saw a small house standing alone beside a narrow lane and behind it there was a field in front of the house there was an untidy garden and there was a green hedge separating the garden from the lane he was looking at the hedge when he saw the sign it was just a piece of board nailed to the top of a short pole and because the hedge had not been cut for a long time the branches had grown out around the sign so that it seemed almost as if it had been placed in the middle of the hedge there was something written on the board with white paint he pressed his head against the glass of the window trying to read what it said the first letter was a g he could see that the second was an a and the third was an r one after another he managed to see what the letters were there were three words and slowly he spelled the letters out aloud to himself as he managed to read them garde au chien garde au chien that is what it said he stood there balancing on one leg and holding tightly to the edges of the window sill with his hands staring at the sign and the letters of the words for a moment he could think of nothing at all he stood there looking at the sign repeating the words to himself slowly he began to realize the full meaning of the thing he looked at the cottage and the field and he looked at the green countryside beyond so this is france he said i am in france now the pain in his right side was very great it felt as if someone was hitting the end of his missing leg with a hammer and suddenly the pain became so bad that it affected his head for a moment he thought he was going to fall quickly he knelt down again crawled back to the bed and got in he pulled the bedclothes over himself and lay back on the pillow exhausted he could not forget the words on the sign it was some time before the nurse came in with a basin of hot water she said good morning how are you today he said good morning nurse the pain was still great under the bandages but he did not wish to tell this woman anything he looked at her more carefully now her hair was very fair she was tall and bigboned and her face seemed pleasant but there was something a little nervous about her eyes they were never still there was something about her movements also they were too sharp to go well with the relaxed manner in which she spoke she put down the basin took off his pyjama top and began to wash him did you sleep well yes good she said she was washing his chest someones coming to see you from the air ministry after breakfast she went on they want a report how you got shot down and all that i wont let him stay long so dont worry later she brought him his breakfast but he did not want to eat he was still feeling weak and sick and he wished only to lie still and think about what had happened and there was a sentence running through his head it was a sentence which johnny his commanding officer always repeated to the pilots every day before they went out he could see johnny now saying and if they get you dont forget only give your name and number nothing else for gods sake say nothing else there you are she said ive got you an egg can you manage all right yes good if you want another egg i might be able to get you one this is all right well just ring the bell if you want any more and she went out he had just finished eating when the nurse came in again she said wing commander roberts is here ive told him that he can only stay for a few minutes she signalled with her hand and the wing commander came in sorry to bother you like this he said he was an ordinary raf officer dressed in a rather badly fitting uniform as he spoke he took a printed form and a pencil from his pocket and he pulled up a chair and sat down how are you feeling there was no answer pity about your leg i know how you feel i hear you fought well before they got you the man in the bed was lying quite still watching the man in the chair the man in the chair said well lets finish this quickly im afraid youll have to answer a few questions so that i can fill in my report let me see now first of all where had you flown from the man in the bed did not move he looked straight at the wing commander and he said my name is peter williamson and my number is nine seven two four five seven
